The dataset includes 1374 images.
Bienso are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 1280x1280 (Fit (black edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
